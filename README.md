# AppliedAI Journal

AppliedAIJournal is a curated collection of "mock-up" projects that reflect real-world AI and machine learning problems I have worked on professionally, along with hands-on implementations of concepts, patterns, and methodologies used in production systems.

## Purpose
This repository serves as:
- A personal journal of applied AI/ML learnings
- A practical showcase of real-world problem solving
- A reference for system design, modeling choices, and MLOps practices

The focus is on **how AI is applied in practice**, rather than purely academic or toy examples. I demonstrate the concepts through open-source datasets of course. :wink:

## What You’ll Find Here
Projects in this repository may include:
- Modular ML pipeline components (preprocessing, modeling, batch inference, and monitoring)
- Feature engineering and data preprocessing patterns
- Model training, evaluation, and monitoring
- MLOps workflows' modules (CI/CD, scheduling, drift detection)
- Scalable data and ML system design examples

Each project is self-contained and documented with its objective, approach, and key learnings.
